## INTRODUCTION 

Every violinist should know how to tune the strings on their violin. Out of tune strings create dissonant and terrible sounds which no one wants to hear. So, at some point, violinists need to learn how to tune their instruments to progress further in their career. 

## THEORY

Make sure when bowing the string, you bow slowly to let the tuner pick up the sound and correctly deduce the note. A diagram of the violin is provided below for reference:

## CAUTION 

Do not use too much force and make only small adjustments when tuning. The strings could snap off!

## STEPS

### Choosing a tuner
1. Clip on or app
###### Note - Many violinists use either an app or a clip on tuner to tune their instruments. You can use either, but many opt for the app as it is free. 
* App - go the playstore on your phone and type in 'Violin tuner' in the search bar. Download the app with the highest rating. 
* Clip on - go to your nearest music store and ask an employee where to find clip on tuners. Ask for their opinion on which you should get.

### Gauging how out of tune your violin is

###### Note - different tuners have different ways of showing whether the string is in tune or not. Most have a needle that points to the middle if it's in tune. 
2. Turn on the tuner, clip on or app.
3. Start with the A string, (diagram below for reference), and drag your bow across the string. 
4. Determine how out of tune your string is. If the needle on the tuner is pointing to the very left or right, that string is very out of tune. If the needle is just a little to the left or right of the middle, that string is only a little out of tune. 
5. Repeat for the other strings.

### Tuning with the pegs 
###### Note - the pegs are the top of the violin, each peg is for each string (diagram below for reference).
6. Determine which peg is for the A string.
7. Slowly start turning the peg either clockwise or counter clockwise and keep an eye on the tuner. If the needle is getting to the middle you're turning in the right direction. 
###### Note - The needle doesn't have to be perfectly in the middle, when you're a beginner it's okay to use fine tuners instead of the pegs to tune the strings.
8. Repeat for the other strings.

### Tuning with the fine tuners
###### Note - the fine tuners are used to "fine" tune, not to make drastic changes in the pitch. Many professionals do not use the fine tuners and instead use the pegs. If you are beginner, it's okay to use the fine tuners.  
9. Again, determine which fine tuner is for the A string. The tuners are in the same order as the strings. 
10. Slowly start turning the fine tuner either clockwise or counter clockwise and keep an eye on the app tuner. If the needle is perfectly in the middle, you tuned your string!
11. Repeat for the other strings.

### You're done!
